   - Detailed logging for debugging
   - Graceful fallbacks for API failures
   - Rate limit handling

Generate this project using TypeScript, Node.js, and the grammy or telegraf library for Telegram bot development. Ensure all API endpoints from the Copperx Payout documentation are properly integrated.
Implementation Details
When implementing the bot, focus on these key aspects:

Authentication Flow:

Initialize with /start command showing bot capabilities
Guide users through email OTP login using the /api/auth/email-otp/request and /api/auth/email-otp/authenticate endpoints
Store tokens securely and handle refreshing as needed


Wallet Management:

Fetch wallet balances from /api/wallets/balances
Allow setting default wallet with /api/wallets/default
Show transaction history with pagination using /api/transfers


Transfer Functionality:

Implement step-by-step conversation flows for sending money
Use inline keyboards for selecting recipients and amounts
Add confirmation steps showing fees before finalizing transactions
Support email transfers (/api/transfers/send), wallet withdrawals (/api/transfers/wallet-withdraw), and bank withdrawals (/api/transfers/offramp)


Real-time Notifications:

Set up Pusher client as described in the documentation
Authenticate with /api/notifications/auth
Subscribe to the appropriate private channel (private-org-${organizationId})
Format and forward deposit notifications to users


User Experience:

Create intuitive navigation with inline keyboards
Format currency values and transaction details clearly
Provide helpful responses and error messages
Include loading indicators for API operations
